                <p>Here is a bag that I didn't finish due to incorrectly sewing the straps together. First experiment with

            <p>This is my portfolio, for my business or for anyone who is 
                interested in commissioning me to do a project. It will be updated regularly. It includes quilts, 
                book bags, and any other projects I have tried.  </p>

        <div class="goals">
            <p>Here are some skills I want to develop: <br>Hand and machine embroidery <br>Sewing with woven/knit fabric 
                <br>Using various stitches <br>Using all presser feet on my sewing machine <br>Designing and sewing clothing </p>

        <div class="future">
            <p>Here is a list of projects I want to do with a description of each one. 
                <br>Sweaters: I'm working now on sewing a sweater using one I have as a pattern. <br>Outerwear: I'd like to do something similar 
                using a heavier fabric instead of a knit. <br>Jelly roll quilt: I want to try making a quilt with smaller strips of fabric 
                and following a pattern, which I don't have much experience with. <br>Themed quilt: I have ideas for quilts I want to design 
                and execute myself.
