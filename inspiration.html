                <p>I started shopping for fabric on Etsy hoping to find it cheaper than at a fabric store. I have definitely found 
                    some shops that exceed all expectations!

                <p>I found this shop on Etsy and they have amazing quality fabrics. They have the best prices for quilting fabric I have seen. 
                    I bought several yards of quilting cotton and batiks, and one of the 1-yd cuts I bought was extra long (about a yard and a half). 
                    I did make a bag out of the fabric I bought and it turned out great. I haven't tried ordering directly from their website yet.

                <p>Sew Yeah has the best quality of fabric, at a regular market price. They sometimes have discounts and deals in their 
                    email newsletter, and a flat rate shipping fee. I love their fabric and they also sell great thread and sewing notions. 
                    90% of my fabric stash is from Sew Yeah. They also have a great variety of fabrics!

                <p>This is another Etsy shop that I love. They have woven and knit fabrics at an amazing price. There are one or two other 
                    Etsy shops that are similar and I'll list those below. I ordered some sweater knits from this shop and they are true to 
                    the descriptions and good quality!
